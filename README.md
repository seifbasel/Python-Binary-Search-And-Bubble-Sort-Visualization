# Bubble Sort and Binary Search Visualization

This project provides a simple visualization of the Bubble Sort algorithm for array sorting and the Binary Search algorithm for efficiently finding elements in the sorted array.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bubble-sort-binary-search-visualization.git
   cd bubble-sort-binary-search-visualization
   
# Run the Code:

Execute the script using your preferred Python interpreter.

# Explore Visualization:

1. Click the "Generate" button to create a sample array.
2. Adjust the speed with the slider.
3. Click "START" to visualize the Bubble Sort and Binary Search algorithms in action.

## Dependencies

- Python (Tested on Python 3.x)
- Tkinter (GUI library included with Python)

## Usage

### Generate Data:

1. Click the "Generate" button to create a sample array.

### Sort Array:

1. Adjust the sorting speed using the slider.
2. Click "START" to visualize the Bubble Sort algorithm.

### Binary Search:

- Binary search is automatically applied after sorting.
- Observe the visualization highlighting the search process.
